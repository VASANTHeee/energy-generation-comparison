Data sources (used to assemble the figures and summary):
- Ember / Global Electricity Review (2024/2025) — country electricity totals and shares.
- Our World in Data (OWID) energy datasets.
- EIA (United States) country statistics (2023/2024 net generation references).
- IEA country pages for India/China where used for contextual confirmation.
Please cite these sources in your assignment; full citations and links are included in the in-chat report text.

Note: The numerical totals used here are Ember/OWID-based estimates for 2024 where available (China 10,066 TWh; USA 4,401 TWh; India 2,058 TWh; Germany 431.7 TWh). Low-carbon shares are taken from Ember/OWID country summaries (China 38%; USA 40.9%; India 22%; Germany 57%).
